Astro Learn Project

The project goal is to develop a mobile app and a website that are fun and interactive that would emulate a 3d solar system.
These tools would be used to help teach children about our own cosmic back yard and to plant the seed of interest in 
their minds.  I intend to do this through a fun and interactive website and mobile app, both which will stimulate interest 
subjects of physics and astrophysics and provide a valid educational teaching tool enabling learning through both visual 
and auditory stimuli.
